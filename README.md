# EventHub – Community Event & Meetup Platform



# Project Description
EventHub is a community-focused web application built to streamline the organization and participation of tech-related events such as hackathons, developer meetups, and study sessions. The platform is designed to serve both event organizers and attendees, providing them with tools to manage and attend events with ease.

Organizers can create and manage events, scan QR codes for check-in, and monitor attendance. Attendees (users) can browse events based on location, RSVP to the ones they’re interested in, receive a QR-coded ticket via email, and track their past and upcoming events through a personalized dashboard.

The entire system supports a real-time event lifecycle—from creation, discovery, registration, confirmation via email, to check-in using QR code scanning.

# Targeted Audience and Objective
The target audience for EventHub includes:

University students looking for tech events and study meetups.
Developers and professionals interested in community-driven events.
Organizers who manage workshops, tech summits, or local programming meetups.

# The objective of the project is to:
Provide a seamless platform for users to discover, register, and attend local events.
Enable event organizers to manage RSVPs, ticketing, and on-site attendance efficiently.
Utilize QR code ticketing to modernize and simplify the check-in process.
Encourage community engagement in tech events through intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.

8. QR Code Ticket Generation (After RSVP)
Once a user RSVPs for an event, the system generates a unique QR code linked to their registration. This QR code is embedded in the confirmation email and acts as a digital ticket for event entry.



9. QR Code Scanning for Event Entry
At the event venue, the organizer (admin) scans the QR code using a scanner tool on a mobile device or laptop. The system checks the QR code’s validity and marks the user as "checked in" for that event.



10. Email Confirmations & Notifications
After a user RSVPs, they receive an email with event details and their QR code ticket. Reminder emails can also be sent a day before the event.
