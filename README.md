# EventHub – Community Event & Meetup Platform



# Project Description
EventHub is a community-focused web application built to streamline the organization and participation of tech-related events such as hackathons, developer meetups, and study sessions. The platform is designed to serve both event organizers and attendees, providing them with tools to manage and attend events with ease.

Organizers can create and manage events, scan QR codes for check-in, and monitor attendance. Attendees (users) can browse events based on location, RSVP to the ones they’re interested in, receive a QR-coded ticket via email, and track their past and upcoming events through a personalized dashboard.

The entire system supports a real-time event lifecycle—from creation, discovery, registration, confirmation via email, to check-in using QR code scanning.

# Targeted Audience and Objective
The target audience for EventHub includes:

University students looking for tech events and study meetups.
Developers and professionals interested in community-driven events.
Organizers who manage workshops, tech summits, or local programming meetups.

# The objective of the project is to:
Provide a seamless platform for users to discover, register, and attend local events.
Enable event organizers to manage RSVPs, ticketing, and on-site attendance efficiently.
Utilize QR code ticketing to modernize and simplify the check-in process.
Encourage community engagement in tech events through intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.

# List of Features with Role-Based Breakdown
1. User Registration, Login & Logout - HETVI SHAH (N01649342)
This feature allows users (attendees) to register for the platform with basic information like name, email, and password. Once registered, users can securely log in and access personalized features such as browsing events, RSVP, and viewing their dashboard. Logout functionality ensures that sessions are safely terminated.



2. Admin Registration, Login & Logout - HETVI SHAH (N01649342)
This feature is for event organizers. Admins can register on the platform and are granted access to advanced features like event creation and QR code scanning tools. Like users, they must be able to log in and out securely.



3. Event Creation & RSVP - HET SHAH (N01651797)
Admins can log in to the system and create events by filling out forms containing fields like title, description, location, date, time, and capacity. Users can browse these events and RSVP for those they want to attend.



4. Location-Based Event Search - RIYA CHAWLA (N01623026)
Users can search for events based on their current location or a specified city. This enhances event discovery and allows people to find meetups relevant to their region.



5. User Profiles & Event History - RIYA CHAWLA (N01623026)
Each user has access to a profile section that shows their basic details and a history of the events they’ve attended or registered for. This feature encourages repeat usage and helps users track their community involvement.



6. QR Code Ticket Generation (After RSVP) - YASH PATOLIYA (N01650844)
Once a user RSVPs for an event, the system generates a unique QR code linked to their registration. This QR code is embedded in the confirmation email and acts as a digital ticket for event entry.



7. QR Code Scanning for Event Entry - YASH PATOLIYA (N01650844)
At the event venue, the organizer (admin) scans the QR code using a scanner tool on a mobile device or laptop. The system checks the QR code’s validity and marks the user as "checked in" for that event.



8. Email Confirmations & Notifications - YASH PATOLIYA (N01650844)
After a user RSVPs, they receive an email with event details and their QR code ticket. Reminder emails can also be sent a day before the event.



9. Admin Panel for Event Management - HET SHAH (N01651797)
Admins will access a dashboard to view the list of events they’ve created, the number of RSVPs, and checked-in attendees. This dashboard helps them manage logistics effectively on event day.



10. User Dashboard with Calendar View - RIYA CHAWLA (N01623026)
Users can view upcoming and past events in a calendar layout. This helps in planning attendance and keeping track of recurring events.
